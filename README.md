### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software developer and Architect with 15+ years of experience in software development.

I'm mostly focused on Microsoft .Net, .Net MAUI Blazor (Android and iOS) and Blazor. Also have professional experience with Angular 2+, some React, some React-Native, some Vue and more. 

I also have extensive experience regarding DevOps going from managing CI/CD pipelines to managing servers (Virtualization, Containerization and more).

I enjoy learning new things and always trying to push the limits.
